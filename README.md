# digidex
My version of what would be a database with information from known digimons until the moment.

<h4>Home</h4>

<span>on the home screen it is possible to enter the name of any digimon that exists until the moment.</span>
<span>the name must be written correctly, it is also possible to search by ID.</span>
<span>In case of empty field, or misspelled text, you will be redirected to the home screen with a reason warning.</span>
<hr>
<h4>Digimon</h4>
<span>in case of success, the data of the chosen digimon will be displayed on the next screen.</span>
